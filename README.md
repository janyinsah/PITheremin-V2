# PIThereminV2
This is an alternate version of the Sonic PI Theremin. Here instead we explore using the pygame module instead of using OSC Messages sent to sonic PI.
Numpy used for mathematical computations which would grab the co-ordinates of the hands and stack them into an array to be interpolated for a minimum and maximum range of values of frequency and amplitude. 
Pygame was used as a mixer to produce a sound file out of the numpy calculations.
